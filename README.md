facebook-data-analyser
======================

Started building a data-analyser for facebook. Based on the entire file you get to download from facebook settings. Most data extraction was complete but ran into the error of reading the content in zip's files being to big for the browsers memory buffer causing it to crash. Explored offline persistent and temporary storage but didn't get lower memory usage: up to about 5-700 mb RAM usage.
